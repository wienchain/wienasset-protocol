## Wienchain Blockchain
WIENCHAIN is an open business and incubation ecosystem on the Blockchain. It is designed as a low friction protocol everyone can build on. With a public funding and proposal system projects are incentivized to use WIENCHAIN. Funds are distributed in an open voting system. Everyone can become a decision maker by staking WIEN token and setting up a masternode. The goal is to leverage and accelerate economic growth by enabling startups and growing network effects.

On top of that, Wienchain is decentralized. Decentralization adds an extra layer of robustness because the Wienchain network has no single point of failure.

All Wienchain transactions are publicly available on a ledger known as “The Blockchain” and quickly become practically immutable.
